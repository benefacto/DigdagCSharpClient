# DigdagCSharpClient
This is a .NET Core 2.1 C# client generated using [NSwagStudio](https://github.com/RSuter/NSwag/wiki/NSwagStudio) with default CSharp Client settings.
It currently supports the 0.9.31 version of the [Digdag](https://github.com/treasure-data/digdag/) server API, which can be found in the digdagSwagger.json file.

The Swagger file was generated by building digdag locally and running in a docker container via the following PowerShell command:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/treasure-data/digdag/
./gradlew cli -PwithoutUi
.\pkg\digdag-0.9.32-SNAPSHOT.jar server --memory --enable-swagger
docker run -dp 8080:8080 swaggerapi/swagger-ui
## navigate to http://localhost:8080/?url=http://localhost:65432/api/swagger.json in preferred browser
